---------------<h1> Welcome to the Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata project! <h1>--------------------- 
This repository contains my implementation of the Gilded Rose practice,
a popular coding kata(self-contained problems that allow developers to practice various aspects of coding, such as writing clean code, refactoring, testing, and applying design patterns)
used to practice refactoring legacy code and adding new features to a pre-existing codebase.
